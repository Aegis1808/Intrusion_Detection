# Intrusion_Detection

## Abstract

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are security tools used to monitor and analyze network
traffic or system activity for potential malicious activities or policy violations. IDS plays a
crucial role in identifying and responding to security incidents in real-time.
The constant growth of computer networks has raised serious concerns about vulnerability
and security, necessitating the adoption of effective intrusion detection systems (IDS).
However, commercial IDS in the market often struggles to identify novel attacks and generate
false alarms for legitimate user activities. To address these issues and enhance accuracy, I have
proposed an approach that integrates correlation-based feature selection (CFS) with a
neural network for anomaly detection in IDS.
My experimental analysis focuses on benchmark datasets of intrusion detection, namely
NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB, which encompasses current attack scenarios. The results
demonstrate that my proposed model outperforms several techniques in 
terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. By leveraging neural networks and
correlation-based attribute selection, I achieved improved accuracy in identifying anomalies
and distinguishing them from legitimate user activities.
Furthermore, my research highlights the potential of deploying such an IDS models for
securing Internet of Things (IoT) servers in the future. This would contribute to the
establishment of robust security measures for wireless payment systems and enable secure
integrated network management, leading to error-free operations and improved
performance.
In conclusion, my study showcases the efficacy of integrating correlation-based feature
selection with neural networks for enhancing anomaly detection in intrusion detection
systems. The proposed model exhibits superior performance compared to existing
techniques, offering promising prospects for securing computer networks and IoT
infrastructures in the face of evolving threats.
